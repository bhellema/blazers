2 lines and everyone with a ball but first shooter

- one line cuts to the elbow (or near it)
- passer opposite side passes to shooter
- shooter watches shot, sprints to get it and passes to next passer and sprints to end

Focus: on calling for the ball, hands up and count your makes!
Focus on inside foot.

Get your rebound and sprint to opposite corner, and then **quick tight dribbles** until you have to pass.

Focus on: 
* calling makes, make sure you communicate
