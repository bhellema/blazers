Two Defence, Two offense:
* defense starts at 3 point line, and one under the hoop.
* offense starts outside the elbows

Defense at 3 point line passes the ball to the offense at the elbow.  The defense MUST CONVERT, transition back as they have a helper under the basket.

Defense has two options going back, take the ball or the basket, and the other defense coming back has to pickup the ball or the basket, BUT THE DEFENSE MUST TALK and tell the other defender what to do, BALL BALL BALL or TAKE THE BASKET.

The SINGLE MOST important thing in CONVERSION (transition) is the basket in this drill, if you get the ball a simple pass will be a layup.

* You need to teach them what to say.
  * talk your task, simply put tell your team mate what your doing.
