Two Defence, Two offense:
* defense starts at 3 point line, and one under the hoop.
* offense starts outside the elbows

Defense at 3 point line passes the ball to the offense at the elbow.  The defense MUST CONVERT, (transition) back as they have a helper under the basket.

Defense has two options going back, take the ball or the basket, and the other defense coming back has to pickup the ball or the basket, BUT THE DEFENSE MUST TALK and tell the other defender what to do, BALL BALL BALL or TAKE THE BASKET.

The SINGLE MOST important thing in CONVERSION (transition) is the basket in this drill, if you get the ball a simple pass will be a layup.

* You need to teach them what to say.
  * talk your task, simply put tell your team mate what your doing.

Two Defence, 3 offense, plus 1 defense:
* defense starts at 3 point line, and one under the hoop.
* offense starts along the foul line
* offense must pass and can't dribble until past half.

Now we need to manage the geography of the floor, you need to manage the basket, the ball, and opposite side of the ball.

YOU MUST COMMUNICATE when tranistioning between defense.

Defense close to basket have two jobs, BALL and BASKET, the other two defense have to see and think where to fill and communicate.

We want to make it hard as we can, _but sometimes the patient dies_.

4 vs 4 - game of switch and change
Right point passes to right side and cuts through to the left bottom key forcing everyone to rotate.  Then the ball is reversed.  If the coach yells switch the players between offense and defense, you can't guard someone else, how are you going to figure out who to guard?  YOU MUST TALK.

* I want to hear I've got ball and you must **communicate to the player next to you**. 

SWITCH STAY
CHANGE CONVERT
