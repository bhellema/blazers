1. Set Up & Motion
2. Post Entry & Split Action
3. Slot PNR
4. Dribble Drive

### Set Up & Motion
Slot, Slot, Wing, Wing, and a Dunker
The post player starts on the weak side dunker spot.

#### Motion
Slot to wing pass - the slot will go through the key, and the other two week-side players fill the slow
Slot to slot - the player making the pass exchanges with the weak-side wing.

#### Ball Reversal Rule
Wing to slot pass, the ball must be reversed - the slot and wing exchange.

### Post Entry & Split Motion
1. The post position starts on week-side allowing for the PG to drive if it's available.
2. If the ball is brought down to the wing, the post will cross to the strong side block and post up.
3. The passer goes into split action allowing the post to operate, (or goes through the key to the week-side corner) 

Split Motion 
  - the passer sets a screen for the next closest player on the parameter. 
  - if the defense overplays, the split motion screener can roll into the key.
  - the passer after setting the screen cuts through and goes to the week side corner

### Slot Pick and Roll
When the ball is being moved from slot to slot, the post comes up and sets a [ball screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSjpPg7qJvY&t=308s).


### Dribble Drive
With the spacing, there's lots of room to drive as an option
- there's always a kick out when the defense collapses
- shooters are always ready t o shoot

### Tips
If the defender turns their heads, automatically the offense backdoor cuts
