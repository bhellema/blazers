Everyone needs a ball, but first shooter.  Two lines starting outside 3 point line, elbow extended.

Instructions:
- first player without the ball cuts to the elbow (or near it)  
- ball is passed from opposite line to shooter
- shooter plant inside foot, catch and square up to shoot, _Where are we going to land?  In our foot prints_
- shooter  then sprints to get it and passes to next passer and sprints to end of the line


Focus: on calling for the ball, hands up and count your makes!
