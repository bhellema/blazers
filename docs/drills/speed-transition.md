# Speed Transition
These drills are to encourage communication.

## Setup
- two teams of 4
- one team is lined up 4 across the foul line
  - the other team is along the baseline

## Instructions 
- coach roles the ball to the hoop
  - players along the foul line sprint to the half court and turn around
  - coach calls a number and the number 1,2,3,4 must run and touch the baseline and hustle back on D to catch up

### Notes
- coaches keep an eye on the hands used dribbling and shooting on each side of the court
- the volleyball court is the playing area
  - between attack lines, you do not take a pass, they get an extra defender at half court.
  - right side of the floor, dribble with right, left and left - train both sides of the body
