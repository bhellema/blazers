# Setup
- Tall player 5 on the ball side to post up.
- 2 on elbow
- 1 on elbow
- 4 week side 
- 3 inbounds

In these scenarios we're facing a man to man defense.  

**Scenario:**
Using the 4 across we can have the team all jump to the ball for an easy inbound.  If it's there we try to hit 5, and allow 1 and 2 to cut through the middle looking for a quick pass.

**Scenario:**
If the pass can't hit 5, 1 and 2 cut through the key and cross and inbound the ball.

**Scenario:**
If the pass can't hit 5, 1 and 2 cut through the key however this time 2 cuts around 1 who sets a screen and 2 takes off down the court.  At which point 1 can turn and seal, or bounce open for a pass.  If they can't get the pass, then that player keeps going and sets a screen of 5 and 5 cuts around the screen looking for the pass.
