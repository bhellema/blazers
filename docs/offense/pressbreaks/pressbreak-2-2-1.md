# 4 Across Press Break for 2-2-1
[Video](https://youtu.be/1KgpwUyxUVs?si=ahPbHb6WftLiFnKe)

**Goal:** Hit the first or second middle cut

If we are facing a 2-2-1 press, we can use a 4 across giving us the 2 extra players up front.  Very similar to that of a diamond press break.

Setup:
![Alt text](image.png)
- Tall player 5 on the ball side to post up.
- 2 on elbow
- 1 on elbow
- 4 week side 
- 3 inbounds

When the play starts 5 posts up, catches and squares up the floor to hit 2 cutting.  If 2 isn't open they continue down the floor, but settle on the top of the jump circle on the other side of half.

*(Looks like a 1-3-1 press break)*

Next 1 cuts through the center, and 5 tries to hit them.  

If 1 can't get the ball on a cut they cut back to the jump ball cirle. The 3 (inbounder) steps into the play to receive a reverse pass from 5, and inturn 3 passes to 4.  4 then looks for 1 who's in the middle cutting up the floor.  If the pass is not there to 1, the ball is reverse to 3, and 3 looks to hit 1 in the middle.
